\title{Election Violence Event Level Data.}
\format{
A data frame with 2925 rows and 3 variables, which are:
\describe{
\item{event_id}{The unique identifier of the event (which corresponds to the event_id in the processed event_reports table and to the final_cluster_id in the clustering table (in cluster attempt 401 to 420).}
\item{election_name}{Standardised name of election.}
\item{event_level}{Manual classification the event intensity into four categories: Riot, Disturbance, Incident, Individual. These categories are based on the Wasserman/Jaggard paper. but with some additions (and an extra 'individual' category.).
\cr \strong{Riot} A serious and sustained outbreak of collective violence, involving the implicit or explicit use of force, intimidation or coercion, and which resulted in physical damage to persons or property â€“ or the immediate fear that such would occur. Riots commonly evoked a magisterial response, such as the reading of the Riot Act proclamation and/or the forcible restoration of the peace by police officers or the military.
\cr \strong{Disturbance} A less serious breach of the peace than a riot, and involved episodic outbursts of crowd violence rather than the type of sustained disorder characteristic of a riot. A disturbance generated a degree of public alarm and usually elicited some measure of official response.
\cr \strong{Incident} A noisy or demonstrative action by a crowd of people that is caused by, interferes with, or disrupts, the proceedings of an election campaign. An incident was a relatively short-lived event that involved little overt violence and invoked a limited or no official response.
\cr \strong{Individual} An action or set of actions involving fewer than 3-4 people, there being no crowd presence or active involvement. Occurrences of individual violence tend to be brief, and often had no effect on the proceedings of an election campaign, but were nevertheless caused by the occurrence of an election.}
\item{imap_constituency_g_name}{Vision of Britain g_name of the main constituency related to the event as found on the interactive map.}
\item{imap_county_g_name}{Vision of Britain g_name of county of the event as found on the interactive map.}
\item{imap_townvillage}{The name of the town or village where the event took place, as found on the interactive map.}
\item{imap_longitude}{Event longitude on the interactive map.}
\item{imap_latitude}{Event latitude on the interactive map.}
\item{imap_event_summary}{An edited brief description of the event from the interactive map (taking all the cluster best descriptions into account).}
